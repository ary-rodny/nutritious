                            Planning your meals is a great way to save time, stay organized, and maintain a balanced diet. Start by setting aside time each week to create a meal plan based on your schedule and dietary needs. Consider breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks for each day, aiming for a variety of nutrients from fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Having a meal plan not only simplifies grocery shopping but also reduces food waste, as you'll buy only what you need. Once you’ve planned your meals, make a detailed shopping list and stick to it when you go to the store.

                            When creating your meal plan, consider batch cooking and prepping ingredients ahead of time. Preparing large portions of grains, proteins, or roasted vegetables early in the week can make it easier to assemble meals quickly. If you know you’ll have busy days, plan for simple meals like salads, stir-fries, or wraps that can be thrown together in minutes. Make sure to include flexibility in your plan, allowing for any changes or leftovers that may arise during the week.
